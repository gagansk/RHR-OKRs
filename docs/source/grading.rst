Grading a KR
------------
Because the Red Hat Research team engages in a wide variety of tasks, it is difficult to set one kind of metric for KRs. However, we have come up with a template that should be used as the baseline while creating targets for your KRs. Well before deciding on grading the KR, map your KR to one of the following types of Key Results based on characteristics and then use the respective grading metrics that are suggested for that type of Key Result.

-----------------------------

Incremental Key Results
-----------------------
If a Key Result is a task to substantially increase a number gradually over a period of time, then we can call that an Incremental Key Result.

**Thumb Rule to qualify**: N to 2N (Where N > 100).

**Examples of Incremental Key Results**: By the end of CY22Q1, double the number of RHR website hits from 3000 unique visitors/month to 6000 unique visitors/month.

**Quantify and Grade Incremental Key Results**: Break the difference between the target and the baseline into equal portions ((6000 - 3000) / 3 months = 1000 visitors/month) across the Quater and set those portions as targets for checkpoints.

+------------------+---------------------+-----------+
|  Check Point     |       Target        |  Grading  |
+==================+=====================+===========+
| CY22 Jan(Start)  | 3000 visitors/month |     0%    |
+------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| CY22 Jan(end)    | 4000 visitors/month |    33%    |
+------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| CY22 Feb(end)    | 5000 visitors/month |    66%    |
+------------------+---------------------+-----------+
| CY22 Mar(end)    | 6000 visitors/month |    100%   |

Groundwork Key Results
----------------------

If a Key Result requires a significant amount of time to be spent on groundwork even before getting early tangible results, then we can call that KR a Groundwork Key Result. These tasks involve actions to build the foundation for increasing a metric, which will then rise sharply near the end of the measuring period.

**Thumb Rule to qualify**: N to 10N (Where N > 1 and N < 100).

**Examples of Groundwork Key Results**: By the end of CY22Q1, multiply by 10 the number of Red Hatters participating in Research projects for a total of 50.

**Quantify and Grade Incremental Key Results**: Identify the steps that need to be made to increase the number. Spend 2/3rd of the time working on these steps. In the last part of the trimester, work on increasing the number.

+------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
|  Check Point     |                       Target                |  Grading  |
+==================+=============================================+===========+
| CY22 Jan(Start)  | 5 Engaged; No additional engagement         |     0%    |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
| CY22 Jan(end)    | 5 Engaged; Indentified additional engagement|     33%   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
| CY22 Feb(end)    | 5 Engaged; Commitment and planned engagement|     66%   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
| CY22 Mar(end)    | 50 Engaged; Onboarding complete             |    100%   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+

Binary Key Results
------------------
If the completion status of a Key Result can only be quantified as a yes or a no, then we can call that a Binary Key Result. These Key Results are tasks to initiate a project or an initiative that didn't exist before.

**Thumb Rule to qualify**: 0 or 1

**Examples of Judgemental Key Results**: By the end of CY22Q1, a production environment of ESI should be running in the Mass Open Cloud.

**Quantify and Grade Judgemental Key Results**: Identify the steps required to initiate the Key Result. Spend the first third of the period planning and identifying the ways to achieve the key results. Reserve the second third for executing the plan. In the last third, test the system for load and longevity.

+------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
|  Check Point     |                       Target                |  Grading  |
+==================+=============================================+===========+
| CY22 Jan(Start)  | No plans for ESI Production Deployment      |     0%    |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
| CY22 Jan(end)    | H/W identified; S/W req. are planned.       |     33%   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
| CY22 Feb(end)    | H/W configured; S/W developed and deployed  |     66%   |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
| CY22 Mar(end)    | The system sustained 50 operations          |    100%   |
