OKRs as Goals in Asana
------------------------

The Research team will be tracking the team's Objective and Key Results as Goals in the Asana application. The OKRS were derived from RHR's `3-year vision document <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1syjL-FOQufBBPOzEMP-bc3ZkiDajklK5vfXjV0nySoc/edit?usp=sharing>`_. Follow the below steps to view the Red Hat Research team's OKRs in Asana:
