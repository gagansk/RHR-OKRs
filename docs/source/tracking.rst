OKR Tracking
============

.. _tracking:

If you are an owner of a Key Result, follow the below steps to keep track of the progress. For the purpose of example, we will walk you through the entire tracking process with an example Key Result. 

**Example Key Result**

``O4-KR2: Production Elastic Secure Infrastructure``

``By January 2022, a “production” deployment of Elastic Secure Infrastructure is in place at the MGHPCC and is receiving feedback from IT admin users at Harvard IT, BU IT, and the MOC who are actively involved in ESI evaluations.``

Step 1: Update the KR in Asana
------------------------------

* Before the Quarterly Kickoff meeting, append **ACTIVE** to the KR heading in Goals. 

 ``O4-KR2 ACTIVE: Production Elastic Secure Infrastructure``

* You will be assigned as the Owner for the goal by the OKR Shepherd. If not, then assign yourself as the Goal Owner.

* Crosscheck the due date by looking at the `Time Period` value. 

 ``Example: Q4FY21 or Q1FY22`` 

* It is highly encouraged to add collaborators to the Key Result. Identify the people who will be working with you to deliver the Key Result and tag them using the `Collaborators` option.

* Make sure the Key result is mapped to the correct Objective by checking the `Parent Goal`.


Step 2: Set KR grading metrics
------------------------------

* Based on the guidelines given in the :ref:`grading-kr` section, identify to which category you can map your Key Result.

 ``O4-KR2 can be classified as a Binary Key result``

* Once you have identified the category, set 3 sub-goals ( 1 for each checkpoint) and assign metrics for the sub-goals in Asana under your Key Result. 

 ``Sub-goal 1: Identify Hardware for the deployment (Due Oct '21)``

 ``Sub-goal 2: Develop multi-tenancy and check network configuration (Due Nov '21)``

 ``Sub-goal 3: Onboard at least 3 individuals and at least 500 leasing operations should be completed(Due Dec '21)``

* Set the status of the Key Result to `On Track`

* Before every checkpoint meeting, update the percentage of completion of the sub-goals.

Step 3: Setup an Asana Project 
------------------------------

* We can't track all the dependencies and the process through Goals. For this purpose, the KR Owners along with the OKR Shepherd are expected to create Asana Projects for each KRs.

* The project name will be just the Objective number followed by the KR number.

 ``Example: O4-KR2``

* The owners are expected to list major issues that are critical for KR success. They can tag the collaborators for any tasks created in the project.

Step 4: Link the Project and the Goal
-------------------------------------

* Once a project has been created in Asana, the KR Owner should link that project to the Key Result in the Goals. They can do that by clicking on the ``Supporting Work`` option. 

Step 5: Create GitHub Project if required
-----------------------------------------

* If a GitHub project exists to achieve a part of Key Result or the entire Key Result, the can be linked using the ``Add Links & Files`` option on the Project's ``Overview`` page.
